## Classical Music Background

With over 15 years of violin experience, I've developed a passion for classical music that complements my professional life. As the 1st deck 2nd Violinist of the School Orchestra in Queens College, I led the Second Violin section and provided training to junior members. Our performances earned recognition, including the Silver Award in the 2015 Hong Kong Youth Music Interflows for our rendition of Tchaikovsky's Serenade for String Orchestra in C major, Op.48.

I've been playing the violin since the age of 8, focusing primarily on classical repertoire. My musical journey has been a significant counterbalance to my academic and professional work in quantitative finance and data science.
