## Classical Violin Journey

I've been playing the violin since the age of 8, focusing primarily on classical repertoire. My musical journey has been a significant counterbalance to my academic and professional work in quantitative finance and data science.

## Recent Performances

- Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra - Guest Performance (April 2025)
- City University Chamber Music Recital (February 2025)
- Hong Kong Youth Music Competition - Judge (January 2025)

## Repertoire Focus

My current focus is on mastering several challenging pieces:

- Bach's Partita No. 2 in D minor
- Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto in D major
- Paganini's Caprice No. 24

## Teaching and Mentorship

I also dedicate time to mentoring young violinists at the Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts, where I focus on technique development and musical interpretation.
