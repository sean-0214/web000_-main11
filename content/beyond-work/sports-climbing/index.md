## Rock Climbing

As Secretary of Welfare for the CityUHK Sports Climbing Society (Dec 2021 - Aug 2022), I:

- Served as the primary liaison between local rock climbing gyms and fitness brands for event partnerships and sponsorships
- Conceptualized and hosted 6 indoor and outdoor climbing events
- Successfully negotiated partnerships with 5 gyms, securing discounts of up to 30% for over 50 participants

## Fitness Achievements

Beyond hiking and rock climbing, fitness has been another significant part of my life. I've taken a scientific approach to training, achieving remarkable progress:

- **Personal Records**: Improved from 120kg deadlift, 90kg benchpress, and 100kg squat to 180kg deadlift, 125kg benchpress, and 145kg squat in just one year
- **Competition**: Earned 2nd runner-up in Hong Kong's largest cross-field fitness competition in 2020 as a lightweight-class (<65kg) lifter
- **Myprotein Ambassador**: Selected as a brand ambassador following these achievements
- **Media**: Featured in a YouTube reality show with over 150,000 viewers

This journey reinforced my belief that scientific methodologies can be applied effectively across all aspects of life, including finance and fitness.
