# International Quant Championship 2024

The International Quant Championship, organized by WorldQuant, is one of the most prestigious quantitative finance competitions globally, bringing together thousands of teams from around the world to develop alpha strategies in a simulated trading environment.

## Achievement

As team leader, I led our four-person team to the global semi-final round, placing in the **top 10.08%** among 4,304 participating teams worldwide. This achievement represents our ability to develop effective quantitative trading strategies in a highly competitive environment.

## Strategy Development

Our approach focused on three key alpha strategy developments:

1. **Machine Learning-Enhanced Trend Prediction**: Leveraged TensorFlow and scikit-learn to analyze historical price data and identify predictive patterns, resulting in a 15% improvement in prediction accuracy.

2. **Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis**: Developed algorithms to identify and exploit correlations between different asset classes during specific market conditions.

3. **Volatility Regime-Switching Models**: Created adaptive models that automatically switch trading strategies based on detected volatility regimes, enhancing performance during market transitions.

## Technical Implementation

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Processing**: Processed over 10GB of market data, including price histories, trading volumes, and various market indicators
- **Optimization**: Implemented genetic algorithms for parameter optimization, reducing overfitting and enhancing strategy robustness

## Impact & Learnings

This competition provided invaluable experience in developing and testing quantitative trading strategies in a realistic environment. Key takeaways included:

- Importance of feature engineering in financial machine learning models
- Techniques to avoid overfitting when working with financial time series
- Methods for effective backtesting and strategy validation
- Team coordination in high-pressure quantitative research

The skills developed during this competition directly translate to my current research focus on applying machine learning to discover investment opportunities and develop robust risk management strategies.
