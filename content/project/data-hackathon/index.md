# Open Data Hackathon 2024 - Hong Kong Techathon+

The Open Data Hackathon 2024 was a 48-hour intensive competition focused on leveraging Hong Kong's open government data to create innovative solutions for urban challenges. The event brought together developers, data scientists, and designers to collaborate on projects with real-world impact.

## Our Project: Urban Mobility Insights

Our team developed a comprehensive data visualization platform that transforms raw transportation data into actionable insights for both city planners and everyday commuters. The solution addressed several key challenges:

1. **Real-time Congestion Forecasting**: Created a machine learning model that predicts traffic congestion with 87% accuracy based on historical patterns and real-time inputs.

2. **Accessibility Mapping**: Developed interactive maps highlighting public transportation accessibility across different Hong Kong districts, identifying underserved areas.

3. **Carbon Footprint Analysis**: Integrated environmental impact data to show the carbon savings from public transport usage compared to private vehicles.

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: React.js with D3.js for interactive data visualizations
- **Backend**: Python Flask API with data processing using pandas and NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Time-series forecasting using XGBoost and LSTM neural networks
- **Data Sources**: Hong Kong Transport Department APIs, Environmental Protection Department data

## Outcome and Impact

Our solution received recognition from the judging panel for its comprehensive approach and potential practical applications. The project demonstrated how data science and machine learning can be applied to improve urban mobility systems and support sustainable transportation decisions.

The skills and connections developed during this hackathon directly contributed to my growing expertise in applying data science to solve real-world problems in urban environments.
