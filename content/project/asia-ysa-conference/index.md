The Asia YSA (Young Single Adult) Conference 2024 was a major regional event organized by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, bringing together over 500 young adults from across Asia for spiritual enrichment, leadership development, and community building.

3. **Fundraising Coordination**: Worked with church leadership to secure necessary funding and donations to support conference activities.

4. **Cost Control**: Implemented cost-saving measures that resulted in a 12% reduction in expenses compared to initial projections while maintaining event quality.

## Key Accomplishments

- Developed and implemented a transparent financial tracking system that provided real-time budget updates to the organizing committee
- Negotiated favorable terms with venues and service providers, resulting in significant cost savings
- Created financial reports and documentation that will serve as templates for future conference planning
- Successfully managed complex financial operations across multiple currencies and payment systems

## Leadership and Team Collaboration

## Impact and Skills Development

This experience significantly enhanced my skills in:

- Financial planning and budget management for large-scale events
